Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
The Gaming Room client is a client that required us to build them a back and front end, as well as an API for the communications between client-server. This application required considerations due to the lack of memory or storage on certain types of media devices which create unique design challenges. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
I believe I did a good job of summarizing the design aspects and ensuring that we hit every requirement that the client had. I believe that development of the domain model also went particularly well, we included all relevant information which would help make maintenance easier as a well developed UML diagram allows you to understand the software with less difficulty. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
I think creating the design document was helpful to truly understand the requirements behind why and how we should implement certain features. As an example, if we did not first understand the relations behind the different classes in this software, we might have built it differently which might have not been in line with most OOP principles. Mainly the principle of inheritance. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
I think that my memory management section could be revised. Looks like we did not truly consider how our actual programming would affect the memory on users' systems. We could have also spent more time on the actual development to ensure that Java's built in garbage collection functions in a way that our program does not hog any resources. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
I spent a decent amount of time ensuring that I had all the considerations and constraints well worked out in order to verify that we had all of the clients requests developed correctly. If we make a mistake in this step of the process, we will drag that mistake deep into the development phase, and as such we need to take special care to get it right. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I think having the UML diagram as well as a general understanding of exactly what we need to do allows me to get this software built without much difficulty. I think that working out exactly what needed to be built was the most important part of this project and allowed for a smooth development. Proceeding with a similar fashion should probably work well for a similar project.
